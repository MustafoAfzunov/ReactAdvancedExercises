Advanced React Exercises

This repository contains a collection of exercises focused on more complex aspects of React development, such as user authentication flows and data fetching. By working through these examples, youâ€™ll deepen your understanding of state management, component composition, and integrating external APIs.

    Sign-Up & Sign-In Flows:
    Learn to create controlled form inputs, implement validation, manage authentication states, and handle common error scenarios.

    Data Fetching & State Management:
    Practice retrieving data from APIs using fetch or axios, handle asynchronous operations, and deal with loading and error states effectively.

    Scalable React Patterns:
    Understand how to structure components, reuse logic through custom hooks, and build cleaner, more maintainable React codebases.
